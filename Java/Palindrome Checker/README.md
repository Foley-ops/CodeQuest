# Palindrome Checker (Java)

## Description

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). Your task is to create a Java program that checks if a given string is a palindrome.

Your program should:

- Prompt the user to input a string.
- Check if the input string is a palindrome.
- Display a message indicating whether the input is a palindrome or not.

### Example

Enter a string: madam
The string "madam" is a palindrome.

## Hints

1. You can reverse the string and check if the reversed version is equal to the original.
2. Consider using StringBuilder or StringBuffer classes which offer a `reverse()` method.
3. Make sure to ignore spaces, punctuation, and consider all characters in lowercase for a uniform check.

## Constraints

- The input string contains only English alphabet characters and has a length of at most `100`.
