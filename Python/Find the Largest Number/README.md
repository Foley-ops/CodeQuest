# Find the Largest Number (Python)

## Description

Your objective is to write a Python function named `find_largest(nums: List[int]) -> int` that:

- Takes a list of integers `nums` as input.
- Returns the largest number in the list.

### Example

For the input list `[3, 5, 2, 8, 6]`, the function should return: `8`.

## Hints

1. Remember that you can't use built-in functions like `max()`. Try using loops!

## Constraints

- The list `nums` contains at least 1 and at most 100 elements.
- Each integer is in the range `-10^3` to `10^3`.

Good luck on your coding journey!
