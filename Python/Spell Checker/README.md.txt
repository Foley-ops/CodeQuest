# Spell Checker Challenge

## Description:
In this challenge, you'll implement a rudimentary spell checker. Given a list of valid words (dictionary) and a word, your spell checker should identify whether the word is spelled correctly and, if not, suggest a list of possible correct spellings.

## Criteria:
1. **Handling Mistakes:** Your spell checker should handle the following types of mistakes:
    - A letter is missing.
    - An extra letter is included.
    - A letter is wrong.
    - Two adjacent letters are swapped.

2. **Dictionary-based Suggestions:** The suggestions should be limited to words from the provided dictionary.

3. **Output Format:** Return the original word if it's correctly spelled, or a list of suggestions ordered by the likelihood of each suggestion being the intended word.

## Constraints:
- Both the dictionary and the word to check are in lowercase.
- The dictionary does not contain duplicates.
- For simplicity, you can assume the dictionary has at most 10,000 words and the word to check has at most 20 letters.

## Input:
- A list of strings `dictionary` (1 <= len(dictionary) <= 10000) where each string is a lowercase word (1 <= len(word) <= 20).
- A string `word` (1 <= len(word) <= 20) in lowercase.

## Output:
- If the `word` is correctly spelled, return the word.
- If the `word` is not correctly spelled, return a list of possible corrections from the dictionary.

## Example:
```python
dictionary = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "fig", "grape"]
word = "applle"
spell_checker(dictionary, word)
