# Count the Vowels (Python)

## Description

Your challenge is to create a Python function named `count_vowels(s: str) -> int` that:

- Accepts a string `s` as input.
- Returns the count of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string.

### Example

For the input string `"hello world"`, the function should return: `3` (because of the vowels e, o, o).

## Hints

1. You might want to loop through the string and check each character.
2. Consider using a set or list of vowels to help with the counting.

## Constraints

- The input string `s` contains only lowercase English letters and has a length of at most `100`.

Dive into the challenge, and best of luck!
