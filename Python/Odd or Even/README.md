# Odd or Even? (Python)

## Description

Your task is to write a Python function named `is_odd_or_even(n: int) -> str` that:

- Takes an integer `n` as input.
- Returns the string "Odd" if the number is odd, and "Even" if the number is even.

### Example

For the input number `5`, the function should return: `Odd`.

## Hints

1. Recall how you can use the modulo operation to determine if a number is divisible by another.

## Constraints

- The input integer `n` is in the range of `-10^5` to `10^5`.

Good luck, and happy coding!
