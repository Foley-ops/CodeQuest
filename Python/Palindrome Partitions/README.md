# Palindrome Partitions (Python)

## Description

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

Your task is to write a Python function named `palindrome_partitions(s: str) -> List[List[str]]` that:

- Takes a string `s` as its input.
- Returns all possible palindrome partitions of the string.

### Example

For the input string `s = "aab"`, a possible solution could be:
[
['a', 'a', 'b'],
['aa', 'b']
]

## Hints

1. Consider the possibility of a recursive (backtracking) approach.
2. A helper function that verifies if a substring is a palindrome can be beneficial.
3. As you move through the string, think about how you can divide it into potential palindrome segments.

## Constraints

- The input string `s` is composed only of lowercase English letters.
- The length of `s` lies in the range `[1, 16]`.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Correctness and accuracy of your solution.
- The efficiency of your code.
- Clarity and cleanliness of your code.
- Proper handling of edge cases and potential anomalies.

Best of luck with the challenge! Dive deep into your Python skills and come up with an elegant solution.
