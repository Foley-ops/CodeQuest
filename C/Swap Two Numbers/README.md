# Swap Two Numbers Using Pointers (C99)

## Description:

Write a program in C (specifically C99) that swaps the values of two integers using pointers.

## Hints:

- Declare two integer variables and two pointer variables to store their addresses.
- Use these pointers to interchange the values of these two integers.

## Expected Outcome:

When provided with two integer inputs, the program should output their values swapped.
