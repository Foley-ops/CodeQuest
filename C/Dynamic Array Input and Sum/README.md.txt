# Dynamic Array Input and Sum (C99)

## Description:
Write a C program that:
- Asks the user for the number of elements they want to input.
- Dynamically allocates memory for that many integers using `malloc`.
- Accepts input for each integer.
- Calculates and prints the sum of all entered integers.
- Finally, frees the allocated memory.

## Hints:
- To access elements of a dynamically allocated array of integers, you can use pointer arithmetic or array indexing.
- Always ensure that dynamically allocated memory is freed using `free()` to prevent memory leaks.

## Expected Outcome:
After entering a specific number of integers, the program should display their sum.
